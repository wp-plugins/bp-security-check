Help combat spam registrations by forcing the user to answer a simple math sum while registering for your BuddyPress-powered site

== Description ==

This plugin will add a field to the BuddyPress registration form where the user will need to answer simple math sum before registering. This is an effort to stop spam bots from registering on your site. The math sum will be composed of adding, subtracting, multiplying, or dividing two random numbers between 0 and 10 (inclusive).
